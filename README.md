# Emaily

This is my attempt to code along with Udemy - [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development).

The purpose of this course is to create a feedback-collection app using NodeJS, Express, Mongo, React, Redux, Stripe, Google OAuth...

## Who am I?

My name is Raphael, I'm a Computer Engineering student at PontifÃ­cia Universidade CatÃ³lica de Minas Gerais and I'm a Software Developer Intern at DTI Technologies at the moment.

## Why did I created this repo?

Because Javascript is AWESOME!!!!!!!!

About a month ago, I started to dive into the Javascript world. In the past, I've written some Javascript code for the company I work for, but when I started taking some React and NodeJS classes, I discovered that I did not know anything about the Javascript world. Almost all my colleagues think Javascript is not a full language, is for lazy people, is not safe, full of bugs... And I have discovered that this is not true and I fell in love with Javascript.

I've done two courses at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux) and [Advanced React and Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial). I love the way the course flows and I think [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/stephengrider) is a great instructor and very passionate about teaching.

## Course Description

Build a large feedback-collection app. This mega app will include the full gamut of features, including everything from authentication to email handling.  You'll learn how to build an app that can be used to send mass emails to a big list of users for the purpose of collecting feedback.  It's my goal to ensure you understand each feature we build into this app so you can apply them to your own personal or professional projects in the future.

### Here's what we'll learn:

* Learn the architectural considerations of building a full stack app
* Connect a front-end Create-React-App server to a NodeJS and Express backend
* Communicate data from your Mongo database to your React application
* Understand how to route user requests on the front end with React Router and on the backend with Express
* Build reusable user inputs with Redux Form, complete with navigation
* Handle credit cards and receive payments from your users with Stripe
* Engage your users with automated emails
* Enhance authentication flows in your app with Google OAuth authentication
* Separate production and development resources with advanced API key handling techniques
* Educate your users on how to use your app with custom build landing pages

### What am I going to get from this course?

* Create boilerplate starter projects with React, Redux, Express, and Mongo
* Understand common web technologies and design patterns to connect them together
* Master deployment techniques between the production and development environments
* Make an app with Google OAuth authentication
* Learn to effectively create and send emails from a backend server
* Accept and process credit card payments from users
